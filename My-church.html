   <div class="main__container_1">
    <b><p>Bryn Mawr Greater Glory Church of God is a dynamic, multinational, multigenerational church located in Philadelphia , PA.</p><p>Our beliefs are based on the Bible and centered on Jesus Christ.</p><p>Our mission is very simple: to lead people to honor and glorify Jesus Christ. That means we’re not about a building or some complicated religious system, but about helping people from all backgrounds discover the joy that comes from knowing and serving Jesus Christ.
    </p><p>We invite you to come and check us out this weekend at one of our worship services.</p><p>We know that going to a new church can be intimidating, so we try to do things in a way where you’ll feel welcome and not like an outsider.</p><p>When you come, you can participate or just sit back and observe. You’ll discover a warm atmosphere, practical teaching from God's Word and lots of friendly people pursuing God together. And with childcare and classes for all ages, your family will love it too!</p><p>God made a promise in the Bible that if we seek after Him, we’ll find Him. You are a valued part of God’s creation and His deep desire is to be in a relationship with you. So come and join us as we pursue God together! </p>
